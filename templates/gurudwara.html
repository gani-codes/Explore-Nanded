      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-left">The Gurudwara is situated on the banks of river Godavari in Nanded. It holds a significant place in the Panj Takhts of Sikhism and marks an important event in the history of the religion. The Gurudwara was built in the memory Guru Gobind Singh Ji, the tenth Sikh Guru. It is also known as Takht Sachkhand Hazur Abchalnagar Sahib, in which Abchalnagar refers to Nanded meaning the dutifully faithful city. The gurdwara has an inner prayer room, called Angitha Sahib, which is the place where Guru Gobind Singh Ji was cremated in 1708. The gurdwara is home to a holy shrine Sri Hazur Sahib, which is well-preserved along with some artifacts such as some bows with arrows and a sword with a stone-studded shield. All these artifacts belonged to Guru Gobind Singh Ji and are well kept in a room known as Bunga Mai Bhago. In addition to these things of religious importance, the gurdwara also attracts tourists with a laser show. It takes place every day between 7.30 and 8.30 pm and shows the journey of ten Sikh Gurus to the viewers in a spectacular way. The gurdwara is easy to reach as there are more than enough ways to reach here including buses, taxis, and auto-rickshaws.</p>

      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-left">Gurudwara Bandi Ghat is located around 400 meters from Gurudwara Nagina Ghat. The gurudwara is named after Bhai Madho Das Bairagi who was a saint who got later renamed to Baba Banda Singh Bahadur. Originally from the state of Jammu and Kashmir, Bhai Madho Das Bairagi has been famous for fighting tooth and nail for the preservation of Sikh legacy.</p>
    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-left">Gurudwara Banda Ghat Sahib , about two furlongs upstream from Nagina Ghat is the spot where Madho Das, a hot heated and headstrong Bairagi Sadhu,had his abode. Guru Gobind Singh had heard about him from Mahant Jait Ram of Singh Dadu Dwara. His original name was Lachhman Das. He was native of Rajauri in Jammu and Kashmir. A Rajput by birth he had been trained in the martial arts and had been fond of hunting. A chance killing of a pregnant doe at his hands transformed him first into a remorseful sinner in search of redemption, and later, after having acquired some occult powers through austerities and single minded devotion to learning of such arts, into an arrogant recluse impatient with lesser mortals, Guru Gobind Singh, within a few days of his arrival at Nanded came to see him here, according to Bhatt Vahi sources on 3rd September 1708. Madho Das was not in his hermitage then, and the Guru decided to wait for him. It is said that in order to test the Bairagi’s mettle, the Guru deliberatly provoked him by having some of the former’s goats slaughtered by the Sikhs. This naturally put Madho Das besides himself with anger as he returned to his hermitage and found the trespass and he sacrillege, and he at once involed his occult powers to bring the trespasser to his knees, but finding them ineffective, he himself took little time to realise and acknowledge the spiritual superiority of the Guru, at whose feet he at once surrendered himself.</p>

      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-left">This gurudwara gets its name from its location. It is situated at the top of a hill and is around 12 km from Gurudwara Hazur Sahib. Its construction is a treat for sore eyes as it is a spectacular white structure adorned by a dome made of white marble.</p>
    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-left">Gurudwara Shikar Ghat Sahib, is a beautiful piece of architecture perched on a low hill about 1.5 furlong from the river bank with higher wooded hills in the background. Its distance from Takhat Sahib by road across a bridge built over the Godavari though kar-seva is about six kilometres. A legend is associated with this shrine, too. It is said that Guru Gobind Singh came here following the chase (shikar) and killed a rabbit which in a former birth had been Bhai Mula, a Sikh contemporary of Guru Nanak Dev.Bhai Mula belonged to Sialkot (now in Pakistan). He had once accompanied Guru Nanak Dev during his travels, but when Guru Nanak Dev went to see him on another occasion, Mula avoided the Guru and hid himself for fear that the Guru might again take him away on a long journey. Guru Nanak Dev went away, but Mula died soon after of snakebite. His repentent soul had since been wandering in different sub-human bodies until, so goes the legend, Guru Gobind Singh emancipated it by the touch of his arrow.</p>
